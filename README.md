# Responsive Card Display with React and TypeScript

This is a simple web application built using **React** and **TypeScript** to display a responsive card layout. The data is fetched from two APIs: one for **places** and one for **tags**. The layout is fully responsive and adapts to both desktop and mobile screens.

**No CSS frameworks were used**. The layout and styling are implemented with custom, plain CSS.

## No CSS Frameworks Used

This project does not use any CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, etc. All styling is done using vanilla CSS, ensuring the application is lightweight and customizable.

Instruction

- Require requesting to JSON endpoints
- Use JavaScript/HTML/CSS to display the details of each card, including:
    - Picture
    - Name
    - Description
    - Tag chip
- Retrieve the formatted data using JavaScript
- Display the formatted data in the HTML + CSS layout created in step A, sticking to the design, placing data where it fits. Donâ€™t worry about pixel perfect.
- You are free to use any framework you wish or do it VanillaJS style
- **No CSS framework**
- Ensure that it should be responsive on desktop and mobile devices

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VishalJangid123/responsive-cards-assignment.git
cd responsive-cards-assignment
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure API URLs

In the root of your project, create a `.env` file. You'll need to define the API URLs for fetching data. Create or update the `.env` file with the following variables:

```.env

REACT_APP_PLACES_API_URL=https://api.example.com/places
REACT_APP_TAGS_API_URL=https://api.example.com/tags
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

After configuring the `.env` file, you can run the development server by executing the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
This will start the app at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Code Overview

1. **`App.tsx`**: The main React component where the card display is implemented. It fetches data from the API and creates cards based on the place data and corresponding tags.
2. **`App.css`**: Custom styling for the app, ensuring a responsive grid layout for the cards. No CSS framework is used; all styles are custom written in CSS.
3. **`.env`**: Holds environment variables for the API endpoints. This allows you to easily change the API URLs without modifying the source code.
4. **TypeScript**: The project uses TypeScript to provide static typing and better development experience with autocompletion and error-checking.
